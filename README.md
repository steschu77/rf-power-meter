# RF Power Meter

A python script to measure signal strength over a range of frequencies between 1 MHz - 8 GHz.

Requires an AD8318 based RF Power Meter as described [here](http://wiki.villagetelco.org/RF_Power_Meter)

The script generates CSV files of the measured data. It also creates a diagram similar to the one below.
